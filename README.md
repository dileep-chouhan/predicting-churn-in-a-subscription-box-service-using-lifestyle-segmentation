# Predicting Churn in a Subscription Box Service Using Lifestyle Segmentation

**Overview:**

This project analyzes customer churn data from a subscription box service to identify lifestyle segments most susceptible to churn.  The analysis employs various data manipulation and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.  The goal is to understand the characteristics of at-risk customers and develop targeted retention strategies to improve customer lifetime value. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings from the analysis to the console, including descriptive statistics, model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), and insights into the most significant lifestyle factors contributing to churn.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., plots showing churn rates across different lifestyle segments) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations help to illustrate the key findings and support the conclusions drawn from the analysis.  The exact filenames of the generated plots may vary.


**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the input data files.
* `src/`: Contains the Python source code.
* `output/`: Contains generated plots and other output files.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the project dependencies.
* `main.py`: The main script to run the analysis.
* `README.md`: This file.
